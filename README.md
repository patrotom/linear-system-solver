# System of Linear Equations Solver

The repository contains a simple implementation of two iterative methods to solve the system of linear equations:

* Jacobi method
* Gauss-Seidel method

The code is located in the [lyn_sys_solver.py](lyn_sys_solver.py) script. It is a simple **Python 3** script. To run it:

``` shell
chmod 755 lyn_sys_solver.py
./lyn_sys_solver.py
```

You have to have Python 3 installed on your computer. Also, you have to install the `numpy` module prior to running it since this is a prerequisite used in the script.
